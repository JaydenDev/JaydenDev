Last Update 5/9/2022

From now on, untested and WIP projects will have time to develop before even being mentioned on the forums. Projects will now undergo 2 weeks of testing and development before having its source code posted, or being mentioned at all on Scratch. This is to prevent projects slid into the mainstream being discontinued as quickly.
